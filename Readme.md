# (Yo) Remote

Toy project to steer the cursor via a standalone web application
thats running nativly on a target machine.

## Motivation

When watching a series over a notebook connected to a tv over hdmi, I
didn't want to get up every time to change episode. So i figured i
needed a nativly running tool that even my fiance can run on her pc.
So i decided to toy around a little with go (my initial approach was a
udp connection over erlang ...).
