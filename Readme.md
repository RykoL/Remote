# (Yo) Remote

Toy project to steer the cursor via a standalone web application
thats running nativly on a target machine.

## Motivation

When watching a series over a notebook connected to a tv over hdmi, I
didn't want to get up every time to change episode. So i figured i
needed a nativly running tool that even my fiance can run on her pc.
I decided to toy around a little with go (my initial approach was a
udp connection over erlang ...).

## Conclusion

I'm really impressed how easy it was to bootstrap a web server without
having ever worked with go before. At the core go seems to keep many
thing simplistic, while still keeping a level of comfortability.

The tooling and the module system on the other hand were felt a little
bit strange to use and i still don't think that i get all of it.
